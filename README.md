## Rusty Minesweeper

This is a simple minesweeper game written in Rust and brought to web with WebAssembly.

The game logic is written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly and to Javascript bindings with `wasm-bindgen`. You can see the Rust code in [`src/model.rs`](/src/model.rs) file and autogenerated WebAssembly code and Javascript bindings in [`pkg`](/pkg) directory.

The game is rendered with HTML mostly generated with simple vanilla Javascript code in [`/frontend/index.js`](/frontend//index.js) file and styled with CSS.

You can play the game [here](https://welf.github.io/rusty-minesweeper/).
